title: About
---

I’m a data practitioner with six years of hands-on experience in a variety of environments.

Professionally I’ve worn several hats, including data engineer, data warehouse architect, and data analyst.

I have a strong passion for intuitive dataset design, crafting delightful interfaces, and creating data models that balance scalability and performance.

I love connecting with interesting and energetic people. Reach out if you want to talk about data, technology, or are just a curious person.
