My experience in data management started with SAS and Excel. A hybrid of automatic and manual processes taught me just how far you can go with creative problem-solving. I then managed data using the classic Microsoft stack. Many people have known this stack: SQL Server, SSIS, SSRS. It works, but not in the way that most people find desirable. Afterwards, I became familiar with one of the new favorites in the startup world: Amazon Redshift, supported by some blend of SQL and Python-based scripting.

What have I learned from all this? I’ve learned that an individual’s technical knowledge is greatly tied to their employer’s stack. I’ve also learned that data management has relatively few approaches, but relatively many options. Just learning the names of available solutions and their relationships is an exhausting exercise.

But I am more excited about the space of data management than I ever have been. The world is fundamentally different now, and it changes every day. Open-source technologies like [dbt](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt), [airflow](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow), and [superset](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset), provide interesting possibilities for relational data in a world that until very recently was locked inside of vendor-specific tools and workflows. These tools allow for defining data transformations in reusable code templates that allow for solving problems with first-principles thinking. The ability to read data from anywhere, store it, model it, and present it for analysis has never been easier. And if you are just getting started with business, the tool adoption [roadmap](https://thinkgrowth.org/the-startup-founders-guide-to-analytics-1d2176f20ac1) has never been simpler to implement.

Further, Slack channels and open-source Github repositories change the way people can learn about data management tools. Best practices and earned knowledge can be shared across the industry in way that it couldn’t a few years ago.  Because information silos were for the most part vendor-locked, knowledge remained tribal. Moving from Oracle to SQL Server was possible, but was less common than it should have been.

Contrast this with application software development, which broke out of most vendor silos a long time ago. In this world, most questions can be answered by the nearest query to Stack Overflow. The community quickly converges on best practices that transcend any one platform or programming language. This is largely driven by the fact that open source encourages knowledge sharing. A rising tide raises all ships.

There are many small changes that companies at all levels are still discovering. I’ve highlighted a few of the more recent disruptions in data management I find interesting.

In predictive modeling, a data management stack might start with Pandas, Jupyter, and Sci-kit learn. For processing that data , the stack might also add Dask if it is hip, and Spark if it isn’t. Joking aside, solutions like Dask are exciting, because they provide opportunities for data people to deploy data pipelines even faster than with Spark (for non-deep learning tasks), since much of the code developed using Pandas will not need to be rewritten to work with Spark’s APIs. These types of alternatives are not groundbreaking by any means, but they are incremental improvements to a landscape that often times has too much mystique surrounding it.

Secondly, many descriptive analytics stacks are now leveraging templating and orchestration tools like  [dbt](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt), [airflow](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow) and the just recently announced [meltano](https://about.gitlab.com/2018/08/01/hey-data-teams-we-are-working-on-a-tool-just-for-you/). These tools provide a level of detailed resolution for processing jobs that isn’t feasible with just cron. Additionally, the maturity of the templating environments in these tools provides a reusability and composability that moves towards sustainable infrastructure growth.

In big data (which I interpret as +1TB), the Apache ecosystem provides sustained disruption, and new approaches to existing problems are being tried all the time. For instance, S3 as a storage solution for infrequently accessed warehouse data, is a novel idea that is superior to the previous solution of restoring and quering data from archived tape. The current leader in querying S3, Presto, is an interesting use case that I believe has yet to reach its full potential.

Modern data management has begun moving towards a post-vendor landscape. This doesn’t mean that vendors will be absent, but that they will look different than the previous generation. For instance, Confluent is the commercial company that provides premium support to Kafka, a free and open-source data streaming tool. With the recent additions of KQL and compacted topics for Kafka, the idea of using it in a fashion similar to a traditional database has become slighter closer to reality. An idea like this is fascinating, because of the dynamics it opens up for JIT analysis and JIT decisions.

Some other thoughts: the ideas of CDC and CQRS are extremely powerful in a world of streaming events. In a world of cheap storage, having separate data stores for dev, staging, and prod can become a true reality, rather than just a staging database that is more of a wild-west area of the data stack than an essential part of a data workflow. A column-store like Redshift makes it more reasonable to go straight to a wide denormalized table, rather than modeling raw data into a star schema first. This can save time and keep pipelines smaller.

Traditionally, the domain of data management has been something of a black sheep in the technology departments of most organizations. The stigma is partly due to the tools historically used in data warehousing, and their distinct difference from the tools used to build software. But now that the differences are dissolving, the world of data management will start to look very different at a lot of companies in the coming years. For some, it already does.
